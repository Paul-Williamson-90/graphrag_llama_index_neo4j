Peter and 
the Wolf 

I lustrated by Richard Hook 



f l^dylSrd 


. 





Once upon a rime, Peter and his 
grandfather lived in a house next 
to a beautiful green meadow. 

Next to the meadow, there was a 
dark forest. 

And in the middle of the forest, 
there lived a hungry wolf. 



“Peter, you must stay in the 
garden/’ said Grandfather. “You 
must never go into the meadow 
on your own,” 

“But why?” said Peter, 

“Because there is a hungry wolf 
in the forest. He might come out 
of the forest and eat you up!” 
said Grandfather. 




Peter looked over the garden wall. 

I he meadow looked very beautiful. 

A little red bird flew up to a tree. 

“Hello, Peter!” called the bird. “Why 
don't you come into the meadow?” 

So Peter climbed over die garden 
wall and went into the meadow. 




There was a pond in the middle of 
the green meadow, 

A duck waddled past Peter, jumped 
into the pond and swam away. 



The little red bird flew down to 
the duck. 

“Come back!” she said. “What a 
funny walk you have! Why don’t 
you fly like me?” 

“I don’t want to fly like you,” said 
the duck. “Why don’t you swim 
like me?” 






The two birds were very cross with 
each other, and they made a lot 
of noise. 

Suddenly, Peter saw a cat 
crawling towards the birds. 

Look out!” called Peter. “ l he cat 
will get you!”

At once, the little red bird flew 
up to the top of the tree and 
the duck swam to the middle of 
the pond. 

The cat saw that she would have 
to wait a little longer to eat. 

She walked over to the tree. 


Just then, Peter’s grand! other 
came into the garden. 

He looked over the wall and saw 

Peter in the meadow. 

lie was very cross with Peter. 





“Come back at once. I told you 
not to go into the meadow, 
said Grandfather. 

So Peter climbed over the wall 
and went back into the gaiden 
with his grandfather. 





Suddenly, the wolf came out of 
the forest. 

He saw the little red bird, the 
duck and the cat.. He was so 
hungry, that he wanted to eat 

them all. 





The cat climbed to the very top of 
the tree, where the little red bird 
was sitting. 

The two of them waited La see 
what might happen. 




The duck jumped out of the pond 
and ran and ran. She ran as fast 
as she could, bur the hungry wolf 
ran faster. He caught her in his 
mouth. Then he ate her up. 


* - 


Then the wolf walked round and 
round the tree where the cat and 
the little red bird were sitting. 

The hungry wolf looked up 
at them. 

The cat and the bird were 
very frightened. 






Peter found a very long rope. 
Then he climbed on top of the 
garden wall. 

Tlv around the wolf s head!” he 
called to the little red bird. “Make 
him dizzy! But keep away from 
his mouth!’ 





The little red bird flew round and 
round the wolf’s head. 


The hungry wolf tried to catch 
the little red bird, but after a 
time, lie was very dizzy. 



Peter climbed up the big tree. 
Then he let down the rope and 
caught the wolf by the tail. 

The wolf jumped up and down 
and tried to get away. 

But Peter held onto the rope. 

‘You won't get. away from me!” 
he said. 


H 





Just then, Grandfather came out 
of the garden and saw Peter 
sitting in the tree, 

“What are you doing up there?” 
he called. 

“I’ve caught the wolf,” said Peter. 
“Look!” 


p 



Suddenly, some hunters came in 
the meadow. 

They were looking for the wolf. 

“Here he is,” said Peter. “Please 
will you take him away, so that 
I can play in the meadow.” 



So the hunters took the wolf to 
another forest -a long way away 
from Peter and his grandfather, 
the cat, and the little red bird. 

They never saw him again. 




And Peter's grandfather let him 
play in the beautiful meadow, 
with the little red bird and the cat. 



Read It Ybnrselj is o series of graded readers 
designed to give young chi I dret] a confident 
and successful stal l to reading. 

Level 4 is suitable for children who are readv 
to read longer stories with a wider vocabulary. 
The stories are told in a simple way and with 
a richness of language which makes reading 
a rewarding experience. Repetition of new 
vocabulary reinforces the words the child is 
learning and exciting illustrations bring the 
action to life. 

About this book 

At this stage children may prefer to read the 
story aloud to ail adult without first discussing 
the pictures. Although children are now 
progressing towards silent, independent 
leading, they need to know that adult help 
and encouragement is readily available, 

When children meet a word they do not know, 
these words can be worked out by looking at 
the beginning letter (what sound does this letter 
make?) and oilier sounds the child recognises 
within the word. The child can then decide 
which word makes sense. 

Nearly independent readers need lots of praise 
and e n cou > a/je aunt I .
